dataDir		the location to store the in-memory database snapshots and, unless specified otherwise, the transaction log of updates to the database.

clientPort		the port to listen for client connections
localSessionsEnabled	false	
localSessionsUpgradingEnabled	false	
clientPortAddress		the address (ipv4, ipv6 or hostname) to listen for client connections; that is, the address that clients attempt to connect to. This is optional, by default we bind in such a way that any connection to the clientPort for any address/interface/nic on the server will be accepted.
secureClientPort

tickTime	3000	the basic time unit in milliseconds used by ZooKeeper. It is used to do heartbeats and the minimum session timeout will be twice the tickTime.
maxClientCnxns	60	Limits the number of concurrent connections (at the socket level) that a single client, identified by IP address, may make to a single member of the ZooKeeper ensemble. This is used to prevent certain classes of DoS attacks, including file descriptor exhaustion. The default is 10. Setting this to 0 entirely removes the limit on concurrent connections.
minSessionTimeout	-1	
maxSessionTimeout	-1	
initLimit		Amount of time, in ticks (see tickTime), to allow followers to connect and sync to a leader. Increased this value as needed, if the amount of data managed by ZooKeeper is large.
